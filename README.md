# Docker Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to provide an introduction to Docker. In particular, you will learn how to Dockerize a simple Django application and how to run it 
in both development and production.

# Dockerfile
The Dockerfile located in the docker_example/ directory is responsible for building our Docker image.

# Docker-Compose
The files docker-compose-dev.yaml and docker-compose-prod.yaml are responsible for running our application along with a PostgreSQL database in both a development
and production environment respectively.
